# Eccentric Exoplanet Modelling

This project is a collection of scripts used to analyse and model exoplanets on eccentric orbits around their stars.

It runs an iterative model to simulate a planet and the heat content the atmosphere of a given planet traps. 

The cumulative heat content is then what determines whether the planets surface temperature remains stable, falls into a snowball state or increases beyond habitability.

## Usage

Each model is available for selection with the `main.py` script.

Parameters for each model can be adjusted in the corresponding scripts in the `models/` directory.
